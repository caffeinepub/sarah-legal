# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the “Free Case Review” section from the one-page landing site and repoint all related navigation/CTA links and copy to a Contact anchor near the footer.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the Free Case Review section/component from the landing page so no element with `id="free-case-review"` is rendered and no unused imports remain.
- Add/confirm a dedicated footer-area Contact anchor and update all nav links and CTAs that previously scrolled to `#free-case-review` to smoothly scroll to the Contact anchor (desktop and mobile).
- Update CTA labels and any remaining on-page copy to remove “free case review” / “case review form” language, including adjusting the footer disclaimer to avoid referencing submitting a case review form while keeping the disclaimer otherwise intact.

**User-visible outcome:** The landing page no longer shows a Free Case Review section; all CTAs and navigation guide users to contact/consultation via the footer Contact area with smooth scrolling, and the site no longer references a case review form.
